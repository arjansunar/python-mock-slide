# Python mock with decorators

### Use Case

- create a service that changes its `Class` or behaviour in runtime
- use the actual service in `PROD` but mock service in `DEV`

### Goal ðŸš€

```python
@with_mock(cls=ServiceA, mock=ServiceB)
class SomeService:
    """
    Service class that dynamically changes during runtime
    """
```
